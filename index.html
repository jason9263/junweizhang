        <h1>Dr. Junwei Zhang</h1>
        <p>Renowned for his meticulous approach to problem-solving, Dr. Junwei Zhang currently occupies the role of Senior Software Engineer at Doordash in Seattle. As a multidisciplinary scholar, his research pursuits encompass the dynamic fields of Parallel Computing, 3D Computer Vision, and Geometry Processing. </p>

        <p>A proud alumnus of Shandong University, Dr. Zhang established a strong foundation in both Computer Science and Mathematics at undergraduate level, before being inducted into the esteemed S3Lab under the mentorship of Professor <a href="https://www.ece.ufl.edu/users/li-xiaolin-andy" target="">Andy
                Li</a> at the University of Florida.</p>

        <p> His quest for knowledge then took him to Stony Brook University, where he embarked on his Ph.D. journey.
                Collaborating with esteemed academicians such as Professor <a
